//! Persistence for the compression recovery store (PRD §9 IP-5).
//!
//! [`crate::compress`] mints the handles and hands back the originals; this module is the I/O
//! half. Kept out of `nasiko-compress` deliberately — that crate forbids itself RNG and I/O so
//! it stays a pure, testable function of its input.
//!
//! # Why this write is awaited rather than spawned
//!
//! The elision marker naming the handle goes out with the request. If the insert were spawned,
//! a fast model could call `recover_compressed` before the row landed and get a "not found" for
//! content that does exist — the one failure mode that would teach an agent to stop trusting
//! recovery, which is the whole point of the store.
