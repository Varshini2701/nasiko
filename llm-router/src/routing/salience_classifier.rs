//! The salience classifier: a hashed n-gram + logistic-regression model that scores how
//! likely a query is to be *substantive* (worth classifying and pinning a model for) rather
//! than small talk.
//!
//! This module owns the model end-to-end — feature engine, weight loading, scoring, and the
//! confidence banding in [`Band`] — and knows nothing about the router. [`super::salience`]
//! holds the [`super::SalienceGate`] impl that adapts it to the routing flow; keeping the
//! two apart means the model can be scored, tested, and retrained without touching gate
//! wiring.
//!
//! Training never happens in Rust: the weights are fitted offline and land here as a JSON
//! artifact, embedded in the binary (see [`embedded_model`]) so the gate has no runtime
//! file dependency. Each weights file records how it was produced in its `provenance`
//! object — training timestamp, training-data hash, L2, and the feature-engine source it
//! was fitted against.
//!
//! **Changing the feature engine invalidates the weights.** Any edit to tokenization,
//! hashing, n-gram ranges, or the dense features changes what a given query maps to, while
//! the embedded weights still encode the *old* mapping — which degrades the model silently,
//! with no compile error and no test failure beyond the behavioural ones below. Refit and
//! re-embed alongside any such change.
//!
//! **Input contract.** [`score`] takes the query text only, matching
//! `SalienceGate::is_substantive(&self, query: &str)` — no conversation-history parameter,
//! per the decision to keep this pass query-only.
