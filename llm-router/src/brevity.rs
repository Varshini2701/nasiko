//! Output-token reduction at the egress seam: a brevity directive appended per request.
//!
//! Runs on the normalized [`ChatRequest`] IR at the same seam as [`crate::compress`], so one
//! implementation covers the OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini inbound surfaces — and, because it
//! lands in the router rather than in an agent's own prompt, it reaches **user-uploaded agents
//! whose system prompts we never see**. That is the only way to reach them.
//!
//! # Why a new trailing `system` message, not an edit to the existing one
//!
//! Anthropic and Gemini hoist every `system` message into one top-level field joined with `\n`,
//! so for them the two forms are identical. OpenAI sends both verbatim. Only the new-message
//! form leaves author-written text byte-identical and stays trivially removable, so that is the
//! form both paths get.
//!
//! Carve-outs and the size floor follow the token-optimization design's IP-2 section.
