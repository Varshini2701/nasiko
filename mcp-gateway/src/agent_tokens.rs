//! Per-agent gateway credentials (`MCP_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) — the agent-identity
//! half of the gateway's two-factor auth (docs/MCP_GATEWAY_AGENT_AUTH.md §2.2).
//!
//! Minted at deploy time and injected into the container env; the agent
//! presents it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/api/mcp` call.
//! Only the SHA-256 hex hash is stored (`agent_gateway_tokens`, mirroring
//! `oci_pull_credentials`); the plaintext exists solely in the container env.
//! Every deploy/restart rotates the credential — env vars can't be recovered,
//! so re-minting on redeploy doubles as free rotation. Destroy tombstones it.
